I am sure that you can identify a good developer if they exhibit the following behaviors:

**Dedicate time to review pull requests**, catching errors that are likely to emerge in production. Additionally, they propose potential solutions to the problems. Personally, I see this as a valuable time investment. It helps me gain an understanding of how the new functionality is being built, making it easier for me to work on it later. If I have any questions about the technical solution, I will ask them or quickly give them a call.

**Always be ready to lend a hand**. No matter what you ask for, they will always say yes (it doesn't always have to be immediate, we all have our timelines and duties). Moreover, if they don't know something, you'll hear something like "I have no idea, but we will figure it out together." I consider this very important, especially when there are junior members involved. After all, we are here to solve problems, not to know all the solutions by heart.

**Don't shy away from tasks that aren't in their role**. Here, I'm not only talking about backend or frontend tasks but also looking into production issues, deploying services, or creating documentation.

**Lead the development process**, from creating the necessary subtasks to deploying it into production. They take charge of coordinating branch merging or end-to-end testing if necessary.

**Take the time to understand how the business works** beyond the functionality described in the user story. This allows them to have a global vision of the product, understand the impact of coding changes on the business, and propose long-term improvements for users.

Remember that a business can operate in many ways, but well-written code will always require an understanding of the context behind it.
