Over time, you come to realize that image compression is crucial for conserving storage space on the website's server.
In some cases, the successful deployment of your website can even depend on it. That's why I
appreciate [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). Here's
a real example from one of my projects, which involved a multitude of images:

Before optimization:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/public/img/pre-compression.png"/>

After optimizing three images, which initially had sizes of 2.44 MB, 1.94 MB, and 1.41 MB, respectively:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/public/img/compression-in-progress.png"/>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/public/img/post-compression.png"/>

And the best part of it all is that you don't notice any difference in terms of quality.
